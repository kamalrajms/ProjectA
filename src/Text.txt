## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.
 
## structure

    applaciation

        node module             -- all installed dependencies..
        puplic                  -- public assets  like img
        src                     --main source folder
            assets              -- images ,svg
            components          -- UI parts
            App.jsx             -- main app component
            main.jsx            --  starting point of our Applications
            index.css           -- global styleing file
        .gitignore              -- tells git which files to ignore
        package.json            -- Project info & dependencies
        package-lock.json       -- it represent node modules dependencies and version
        vite.config.json        -- vite configuration files
        READM.module            -- project documentation.

## conditional rendering 

    conditional rendering means showing or  hiding  parts of
    UI based on some conditions .

        ternary operator (condition? statement:statement)
        logical operator (&& ,||, !)

## list rendering 

    Rendering multiple items dynamically using map()

## hooks
## useState()

    useState is a react hook that allows you to add state (
    data that can change over time) to a functional components.

    normally , in js functionality , variable disappear after functional runs. 
    but with usestate , react remembers values between re-renders.

    syntex:

    const[state,setState]=usestate(initial-state)

    state ---the current value of the state variable
    setState --- a functional that update the state
    initial-state--- the starting value of the state

## useEffect()

    in react ,useEffect is a hook that lets you perform 
    side Effect in functional component.

    Side Effect are the task that happends outside the 
    normal react rendering process ,like...
            Fetching data from API
            Updating the browser  DOM manually
            Statring/stoping timers


    synteX:

        useEffect(()=>{
            //code ...
        },[dependency1,dependency2,...])

## useRef()

    UseRef is a react hook  that gives you a box (.current) you can store anything in-
    like-- num,str,object,function,even DOM element.

    That value persists between renders.

    Updating it does not cause your component to re-rendering

    {current:value}
